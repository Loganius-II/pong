# Pong
## I created this game using pygame on the fly. I had the idea of creating pong on my own. I had never seen how other people had done it because I wanted to see how independant I was. Boom! There it is. The code probably hurts the eyes of experienced pygame developers as this code is probably **NOT** very readable. 

# Functionality:
 - Functions as a normal Pong game
 - Stores both player 1s and player 2s high score
 - Stores longest time played in a single round
 -  Displays highest scores at the start of program
 -  Ball has random or dynamic characteristics to it such as:
    - Speed of travel (dynamic and random)
    - Directions
    - The player it goes to first
- Displays time
- Displays each players score 

# The Pong Folder:
 - Contains a distributable `.exe` application file
 - The entire Pong folder must be downloaded in order for the whole thing to work
 - To Run:
    - Double click on the application file
    - If you get a popup saying "Windows protected your PC" or something like that just press "See more" and "Run anyway"
    - It should run after that
    - If it doesn't, be sure that you have everything correctly installed
