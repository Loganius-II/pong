# Pong
## I created this game using pygame on the fly. I had the idea of creating pong on my own. I had never seen how other people had done it because I wanted to see how independant I was. Boom! There it is. The code probably hurts the eyes of experienced pygame developers as this code is probably **NOT** very readable. 

# Functionality:
 - Functions as a normal Pong game
 - Stores both player 1s and player 2s high score
 - Stores longest time played in a single round
 -  Displays highest scores at the start of program
 -  Ball has random or dynamic characteristics to it such as:
    - Speed of travel (dynamic and random)
    - Directions
    - The player it goes to first
- Displays time
- Displays each players score
